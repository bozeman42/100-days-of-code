# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with a few methods of capturing input from a QR code reader. Time based and prefix based.

**Thoughts:** The time based method is *close* to being what I want, but I am having difficulty figuring out how to prevent text from showing up when scanned, but allowing keyboard input.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
